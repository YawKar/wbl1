# Difference between RWMutex and Mutex
RWMutex allows to have multiple readers simultaneously whilst permits only 1 writer at any given moment.

Mutex, on the other hand, doesn't distinguish between read and write access.

# It is prohibited to acquire recursive read locks due to possibility of dead lock
If some G1 acquires read lock and after that the other one G2 tries to acquire write lock,
G2 will block waiting for G1's read lock to be released. And if at that moment G1 will try to take a new recursive read lock
without releasing the first one, it also will block because no readers should expect to be able to acquire read lock while
write lock acquiring was requested (which indeed was by G2). As such - we'll get deadlock or "all goroutines are asleep" panic in case there were these 2 Gs (plus other waiting for one of them).
